      Dear Affluent team,<br />First of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity to take
      this test task. I enjoyed being challenged with this small project and hopefully can continue
      the process of hiring.

      I really have strong interest in this position of Vue Developer and surely can become a
      valuable asset in the company. As an adept of JavaScript and Vue Developer, I have a
      well-rounded skill based on my previous experience. Also I can work outside my comfort and
      knowledge set and can use any new development techniques to achieve the success in your
      company.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">I look forward to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience.</p>
